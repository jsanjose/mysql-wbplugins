# mysql-wbplugins

This is the MySQL Workbench plugins I've developed so far, to help me, and others, to enhance the functionality of this tool.

## Installation instructions

* Navigate to **Scripting** -> ***Install Plugin/Module...*** and open the corresponding '.py' file.
* Restart the Workbench when asked.
* The script can be found under: **Tools** -> ***Utilities***


## List of plugins

* **Generate documentation (HTML) [*mysql-wbplugin-htmlmodeldoc.py*]**: This plugin generates HTML documentation for the current Model. It generates documentation for all the tables in HTML, and copies it to the clipboard. Just paste it into the editor of your choice. *This plugin is based in [MySQL Workbench Model Document Generation](https://github.com/letrunghieu/mysql-workbench-plugin-doc-generating) by Hieu Le Trung*
